# Blog Project

This is a blog application developed using ASP.NET MVC to solidify my understanding of fundamental web development concepts. The project includes CRUD operations, routing, model binding, and utilizes dependency injection. ASP.NET Identity is integrated for user authentication and authorization, providing secure access to different parts of the application. The Admin area allows managing categories and posts, with a responsive layout designed using Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End
- **HTML:** For structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling and enhancing the visual appearance.
- **JavaScript:** To add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the application.
- **Bootstrap:** For creating a responsive and mobile-friendly layout with pre-built components.

### Back-End
- **C#:** For server-side logic and application functionality.
- **ASP.NET Core:** For building the web application using the MVC pattern.
- **MVC Pattern:** To separate concerns and structure the application for easier maintenance.
- **MS SQL Server:** For database management and data persistence.

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data access logic and provide a clean separation between the business logic and data layer.
- **Unit of Work Pattern:** To manage transactions and maintain data consistency across multiple operations.
- **Dependency Injection:** To achieve loose coupling and increase the flexibility and testability of the application.

## Architecture
- **N-Tier Architecture:** The application is structured into multiple layers, including Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access layers, promoting a clean separation of concerns and enhancing scalability and maintainability.
